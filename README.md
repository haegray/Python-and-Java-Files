# Python-and-Java-Files
Samples of python and java code I've done

ChocoCanyon.java and Main.java simulate the resources and mortality of a village, Chaco Canyon, iterating by year. 
Main.java calls the ChocoCanyon object.

monty2.py  is a file that simulates a 3 card Monty card game.

GameGlobals.java, GameWindow.java, and HoleButton.java are three different files used to simulate a Whack-a-Mole game.

Collisions.java simulates two balls colliding.

These files are the culmination of other files found in this folder, 
which were created during courses taken at the University of Mary Washington,
each of which illustrates a different skill learned in Python or Java.
